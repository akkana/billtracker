The pytests can't be run in one go (e.g. pytest tests/)
because pytest uses one process to run all the tests sequentially,
meaning the database will accumulate cruft from previous tests.
I haven't found a way to reset the database between tests;
all the db-clearing methods require a session, and the
test_client.session_transaction isn't the right kind to make
sqlalchemy happy.

So use tests/run_tests instead.
