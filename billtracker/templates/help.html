<h1>NM Bill Tracker Help</h1>

<p>
For now, just a few tips on things that might not be obvious:

<h3>How Do I Track a New Bill, or Stop Tracking a Bill?</h3>
<p>
There are two ways to add bills to your tracking list,
or remove them from the list.
<p>
The easiest way is the <a href="/allbills">>All Bills</a> page,
which lists the titles of all the bills in the current session..
Bills you haven't seen before will be listed first, under <b>New Bills</b>.
All other bills will be listed underneath.
<p>
Each bill has either a <i>Track</i> button (if you're not yet tracking it)
or an <i>Untrack</i> button. Click the Track/Untrack buttons on as many
bhills as you want to add or remove, then click <i>Track/Untrack</i>.
<p>
If you know the designation (e.g. SB1) of a specific bill you want to track,
the <a href="/addbills">>Track More Bills</a> page lets you type in a
bill designation then click <i>Track a Bill</i> to add it to your list.
That page also shows all the bills you're tracking,
so you can remove bills from your list by marking the <i>Untrack</i>
button next to the bills you want to remove, then clicking
<i>Untrack Bills</i>.

<h3>How Do I Find Out About New Bills?</h3>
<p>
The <a href="/allbills">All Bills</a> page keeps track of the
bills you've seen,
and will show you new bills you haven't seen yet at the top,
along with bills that have had some sort of major change.

<p>
Or you can go to the <a href="/popular">Popular Bills</a> page,
where you can get an idea of which bills other people are tracking.
It's a good way to notice bills you might care about that you
might not otherwise have noticed. This page also has <i>Track</i>
and <i>Untrack</i> checkboxes; be sure to click the
<i>Track / Untrack</i> button after you've made your selections.

<h3>Can I use the Bill Tracker Without an Account?</h3>
<p>
The main purpose of the Bill Tracker is to keep an eye on your specific
list of bills, and most of its pages don't make sense without that.
But the <b>All Bills</b> page is available without logging in,
offering links to every bill filed in the current session along with
links to the bill's page on NMLEGIS and the text (contents) of the bill.
Of course, if you're not logged in, the page won't keep track
of which bills are new.

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>
You can change your password or email address here.
Email addresses must be confirmed: you will get an email from the BillTracker
with a confirmation code. Without a confirmed email address, you
can still use the BillTracker website.
<p>
If you no longer want to receive email alerts you can clear your
email address.

<h3>NMLEGIS Links Open in a New Tab</h3>
<p>
Most links on the BillTracker to a bill, committee or legislator
will open in a new tab, so your BillTracker page is still available.

<h3>Links Page</h3>
<p>
The Links page has links I've found useful for navigating the
legislative session. For instance, for committees that don't list
their schedules on the committee's page, you can find a list of
<i>all</i> committee calendars, as well as the House and Senate
calendars, on the Links page.
<p>
Many of the links are to the League of Women Voters of New Mexico.
The BillTracker is run by the LWVNM webmaster and was originally
intended to be a LWVNM project; it was split off as a separate project
primarily because of technical limitations on the LWVNM's web host.

<h2>Other Questions?</h2>
<p>
If there's something you find confusing in the BillTracker that you
think should be documented here,
