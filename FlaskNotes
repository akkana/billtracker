# Notes on Flask

(helpful when adding new functionality)

# Templates

Any variables that you want a template to be able to access with {{ var }}
should be passed as render_template(..., var=value) otherwise the template
won't see them (except certain global variables, maybe).

# Form submission:

To add a new form, reate a URL in routes.py, a class in forms.py,
and a template in templates/.

Validation happens in forms.py.
Any code that does something useful with the submitted data needs
to go in routes.py.
routes.py is also the place to clear the form field if you go back to
the same form after submitting.
