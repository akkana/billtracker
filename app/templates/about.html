<h1>About the New Mexico Bill Tracker</h1>

<p>
The NM Bill Tracker is a free service for following pending legislation
in the New Mexico legislature,
written by Akkana Peck.
<p>
I wrote it because I was frustrated at how difficult it is
to find out when bills are actively being considered in the
legislature. I wanted something I could use to track bills
and send me alerts when important issues are coming up for a vote.
<p>
I also want to help make it easier for everybody to keep track
of what our government is doing and take an active role in government,
to help our state move in the right direction.
If you're interested in being more active in New Mexico's government,
the NM League of Women Voters has lots of info on the
<a href="https://www.lwvnm.org/Action/">LWVNM Action page</a>
(disclaimer: I'm also the webmaster for LWVNM).

<h2>Privacy and Email Addresses</h2>
<p>
The NM Bill Tracker doesn't store any personal information about you.
It asks for your email address so it can send you updates on bills.
Email addresses are not used for any other purpose, and will never be
shared with outside projects or companies, or with other
NM Bill Tracker users.
<p>
If you don't want email updates and just want to check bill status
online with a web browser, you can leave the email field blank.
<p>
If you initially provide an email address, then change your mind and
decide you don't want email updates after all, go to
<a href="/settings">Settings</a> and make the Email field blank.
<p>
No one else can see the bills you put in your list. The only thing
you can see involving other users is the number of users following
each bill.

<h2>Shout-out to NMLegisWatch</h2>
<p>
Starting in 2025, there's a very similar project called
<a href="https://nmlegiswatch.org/">NM LegisWatch</a>, written by
Ed Santiago. The two projects are cooperative:
Ed and I have shared code and data for the NM legislature for years.
The NM Bill Tracker links to some pages on NM LegisWatch,
in particular, to the excellent bill and legislator summary pages,
and it uses data pulled by NMLegisWatch. The feature sets for the
two projects are similar but not identical, so use whichever one
suits your needs best ... or use both!

<h2>Can the BillTracker be used in other states?</h2>
<p>
Right now the Bill Tracker only works in New Mexico, but it shouldn't
be that hard to extend it to any state that makes bill status available
online.
<p>
The NM Bill Tracker uses Python's Beautiful Soup module to scrape the
New Mexico Legislative website. To use it in another state, you would
need a way to get that data for your own state, which might involve
web scraping, or (in a few enlightened states) there might be an
easier way.
<p>
if you're interested in using my Bill Tracker in your state, I'd be
happy to work with you to integrate scrapers for other states into
the Bill Tracker source code. Drop me a line.

<p>
The BillTracker is free open source software, written in Python using Flask.
The <a href="https://github.com/akkana/billtracker">BillTracker source code
is on GitHub</a>. Contributions, bug reports and bug fixes are welcome!
