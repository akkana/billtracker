<h1>About the New Mexico Bill Tracker</h1>

<p>
BillTracker is a free service written by Akkana Peck.
<p>
I wrote it because I was frustrated at how difficult it is
to find out when bills are actively being considered in the
legislature. I wanted something I could use to track bills;
and I figured, if I wanted that, maybe other people did too.
<p>
And besides, if I help make it easier for people to keep track
of what our government is doing, maybe more people will be
active and help our state move in the right direction.
<p>
BillTracker collects email addresses so it can send you updates.
I promise I won't do anything nefarious with your email address;
it is used only by billtracker during the legislative session.
If you don't want updates and just want to check your bill
page online, you can leave the email field blank.

<p>
Right now BillTracker only works in New Mexico, but it should be
fairly easy to extend it to any state that has bill status online.
NMBillTracker uses Python to scrape the New Mexico Legislative website;
if you're interested in using BillTracker in your state, of course
you can fork the code, but I'd also be happy to work with you to
integrate scrapers for other states into the BillTracker base source.

<p>
This app is fully open source, using Python and Flask as a backend:

<h1>Known Bugs</h1>
<p>
Currently BillTracker is still in early development, and there are
some features that aren't implemented yet:
<ul>
<li>No email support yet: you can only view bills on the web.
Coming soon!
<li>Loading takes forever if the bills aren't updated (e.g. if you
haven't loaded in a few hours). I'm working on a way to show progress.
<li>There's no way to tell whether a bill has Amendments or a FIR or LESC
report: links are shown regardless. That's because the legislative website
now serves zero-length files if you request any PDF. I hope I can find a
way around this besides downloading the PDFs every time a bill is checked.
<li>No way to remove bills from your list in case you mistype one or
just lose interest. Coming soon.
<li>Probably lots of other stuff I haven't noticed yet.
</ul>
