<h1>About the New Mexico Bill Tracker</h1>

<p>
The NM BillTracker is a free service for following pending legislation,
written by Akkana Peck.
<p>
I wrote it because I was frustrated at how difficult it is
to find out when bills are actively being considered in the
legislature. I wanted something I could use to track bills
and let me know when important issues are coming up for debate
or for a vote.
<p>
And besides, if I help make it easier for people to keep track
of what our government is doing, maybe more people will be able to
take an active role in New Mexico's government
and help our state move in the right direction.
(I'm also the webmaster for the League of Women Voters of New Mexico,
which has lots of useful legislation-related links on the
<a href="https://www.lwvnm.org/Action/">LWVNM Action page</a>.)
<p>
NMBillTracker collects email addresses so it can send you updates on bills.
Email addresses are not used for any other purpose, and will never be
shared with outside projects or companies.
If you don't want email updates and just want to check bill status
online with a web browser, you can leave the email field blank.

<p>
BillTracker is free open source software, written in Python and Flask.
<a href="https://github.com/akkana/billtracker">Billtracker source code
is on GitHub</a>. Contributions are welcome!

<h1>Known Bugs and Missing Features</h1>
<p>
Currently BillTracker is still in early development, and there are
some known bugs:
<ul>
<li>There's no way to tell whether a bill has Amendments or a FIR or LESC
report: links are always shown. That's because the legislative website
now serves zero-length files if you request any PDF. I hope I can find a
way around this besides downloading the PDFs every time a bill is checked.
<li>Probably lots of other stuff I haven't noticed yet.
</ul>
<p>
Use it at your own risk, but I welcome feedback.
I hope you find it useful during our 2019 session!

<h3>Can it be used in other states?</h3>
<p>
Right now BillTracker only works in New Mexico, but it should be
fairly easy to extend it to any state that has bill status online.
The NM BillTracker uses Python to scrape the New Mexico Legislative website.
if you're interested in using BillTracker in your state, I'd be
happy to work with you to integrate scrapers for other states into
the BillTracker source code.
Drop me a line.
