You requested a password reset for user {{ recipient }}
on the New Mexico Bill Tracker.

Your new password is: {{ newpasswd }}

Ideally, you should log in and change it right away.
Unfortunately, I haven't implemented password changing yet
(working on it!), so for now, please write this password down,
and I'll try to get a password change page working soon.

If you still have a problem logging in, contact Akkana (akkana@shallowsky.com).
