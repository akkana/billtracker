Enabling Daily Emails, or other timed services

# Systemd timers:

- Edit billtracker-emails.timer and adjust the time as desired
- Edit billtracker-emails.service and change the KEY to the secret key
  you're using.
- Move billtracker-emails.timer and billtracker-emails.service
  into /lib/systemd/system,
  (on some systems /etc/systemd/system/ or some other location may be better).

Then:

systemctl enable billtracker-emails.timer
systemctl start billtracker-emails.timer

Verify the timer was added by listing timers:
systemctl --no-pager list-timers



#  Crontab:

If you don't use systemd, crontab's format is:

MIN HOUR DAY MON DOW CMD
09  22   *   *   *   wget https://nmbilltracker.com/api/all_daily_emails/KEY -O /var/log/billtracker-emails.out
