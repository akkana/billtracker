Enabling Daily Emails, or other timed services

# Systemd timers:

Assume the billtracker is installed at $BILLTRACKERHOME

- Edit billtracker-update.timer and adjust the time as desired.

- Edit billtracker-update.service and adjust the path to billtracker-update.py.

- Copy billtracker-update.timer and billtracker-update.service
  into /lib/systemd/system
  (on some systems /etc/systemd/system/ or some other location may be better).

- Copy $BILLTRACKERHOME/billtracker/system-timers/billtracker-update.py
  into $BILLTRACKERHOME so you'll have a copy you can edit.

- Edit $BILLTRACKERHOME/billtracker-update.py and change MY_SECRET_KEY
  and BASEURL.
  (Yes, there ought to be a better place to set these. Working on it.)

- Copy billtracker-update.timer and billtracker-update.service
  into /lib/systemd/system
  (on some systems /etc/systemd/system/ or some other location may be better).

- Edit /lib/systemd/system/billtracker-update.service and adjust the path
  to call $BILLTRACKERHOME/billtracker-update.py.
  Verify that it's pointing to the version with the key set properly.

Then:

systemctl enable billtracker-update.timer
systemctl start billtracker-update.timer

Verify the timer was added by listing timers:
systemctl --no-pager list-timers

In case you ever need to disable it:
systemctl disable billtracker-update.timer
