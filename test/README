Run all tests with:

test/run_tests

(from the top level, i.e. one level above this test directory).

**** IMPORTANT ****

DON'T USE python3 -m unittest discover: it overrides values used
for the testing database and MAY DESTROY YOUR REAL DATABASE
if you run it with DATABASE_URL in your environment.
This may be because unittest tries to import the billtracker module
as an additional test; it doesn't confine itself to the tests directory.
I haven't found any way around this.

You can run single tests like this:

python3 -m unittest test.test_billtracker
python3 -m unittest test.test_billtracker.TestBillTracker.test_bills
