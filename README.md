## New Mexico Bill Tracker

Track bills as they move through the New Mexico legislature's website,
by scraping the nmlegis.gov website. Send alerts when a bill's status
changes, e.g. when it moves to a new committee so it might be time
to go to a hearing or write letters to committee members.

The project name isn't specific to New Mexico since most of the code
could be extended to any state or venue that offers bill information
online. I'd welcome contributions from other states or, especially,
for federal bills.
